## About me 
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at UMass Amherst, where I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. My academic and professional experiences have fueled my passion for uncovering insights from data and applying them to solve real-world problems. With skills in Python, R, SQL, C#, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy working on diverse projects that allow me to explore the intersection of technology and social science.

In addition to programming, I have hands-on experience with tools like NumPy, Pandas, Streamlit, REST APIs, Scikit-Learn, Tidyverse, Power BI, Tableau, and ArcGIS. I’m particularly interested in areas such as ETL processes, data engineering, machine learning, research design, and data pipelines. I’m always eager to apply my technical expertise to data-driven challenges and collaborate with teams to drive impactful solutions. Let's connect if you share a passion for data science, quantitative analysis, or machine learning!

## Projects

### Geospatial Data Extraction and Integration for Correlation Analysis in Tucson, Arizona
- **Objective:** Develop an efficient extraction and integration workflow for geospatial datasets, including LANDSAT imagery analysis to obtain derived indices (NDVI, SAVI, NBDI, MNDWI), SRTM elevation data, and land cover information. This dataset supported advanced correlation analysis with machine learning, focusing on environmental variables to urban planning and sustainability studies.
- **Tools Used:** ArcGIS Pro, Spatial Analysis, Imagery Analysis, ArcPy, Python
- **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/eiig26/extraction-imagery](https://github.com/eiig26/extraction-imagery)
- Mainf Findings:

### From Data to Decisions: Understanding the Housing Prices determinants in Massachusetts
- **Objective:** Examine the impact of various factors on housing prices in Massachusetts using regression models, analyzing house features (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, lot size), location, median household income, population density, and crime index.
- **Tools Used:** R (Tidyverse, ggplot2, linear model)
- **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/eiig26/housing_predictions_603](https://github.com/eiig26/housing_predictions_603)

### Analysis of Sexual Crime Trends in the Los Angeles: Spatio-Temporal perspective with GIS
- **Objective:** Detect and explore sexual crimes trends in Los Angeles using official LAPD data and ArcGIS Platform to incorporate data transformation and a range of visualizations, including 3D and space-time techniques like the Space Time Cube and Hot Spot Analysis, to study relationships between crime incidents, time, and spatial patterns.
- **Tools Used:** ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Notebooks, ArcPy, Python, Spatial Analysis, ArcGIS Online
- **StoryMap:** [https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/6e4a083720b54f8b978e928c78c608c9](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/6e4a083720b54f8b978e928c78c608c9)
